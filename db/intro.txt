Hello! My name is Ilanri van Rossum and I am a 22 year old female Christian. I have an interesting background since I was born in Witbank (eMalahleni), spent my next 8 years in S'Heerenbergh in the Netherlands and the 10 after that in Piketberg in the Western Cape. Nowadays my time is spent between Stellenbosch and Betty's Bay where my parents, who have been happily married for the past 33 years, live. I have always have a love for maths and when I found out about the data science degree from an open day in 2019, my interest was peeked. Although I did not have I.T. as a subject in Matric and have never coded in my life, I was ready to fully submerge myself in this new challenge. Looking back almost 4 years later, I have never regretted my descision and enjoyed all the ups and downs I experienced and I am proud to say I now enjoy coding and figuring things out. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, building puzzles, going for runs or hikes and reading psycholologically interesting books.
